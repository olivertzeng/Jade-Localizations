# Jade Localizations

Thanks for the interest in helping translate the tweak to your language! Here is how you can do it.

Firstly, get a copy of the file located [here](/Localizable.strings) and open it with your favorite text editor.

You will notice that on the left of the `.strings` file, there are keys in UPPERCASE. Those keys are universal throughout all languages, so they should not be modified. What does need to be modified is the text in the quotes. So for instance, let's say we have:

```
TEXT_COLOR = "Text Color";
```

In the English file and we want to translate it to Spanish. We would translate it like this:

```
TEXT_COLOR = "Color del texto";
```

Notice how the right side is translated whilst keeping the left side the same.

Please try and keep the translations universal throughout your language, so that it's not specific to a dialect. That way, most speakers of your language will be able to understand you.

After you're done, please contact me through Discord. You can join my Discord server, with the link being:

I will get back to you as soon as possible and I will ask you to send over the `.strings` file, as well as the name of the language.

If you do not have Discord, you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NightwindDev).
